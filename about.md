My name is Evgeny Manzhosov. 

Currently, I am working on my Ph.D. under the supervision of prof. [Simha
Sethumadhavan](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~simha/) at Columbia University. 

At the beginning of my Ph.D., I worked on memory safety and pointer integrity
solutions, afterward drifting towards the intersection of security and
reliability of systems. My current work is focused on the intersection of
security and reliability for general-purpose and specialized computing (e.g.,
ML, ML with Homomorphic Encryption).

Before joining prof. Sethumadhavan's Lab, I finished my MSc degree at the
Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University with an Award of
Excellence. During my masters I worked on a number of research projects in the
Lightwave Research Laboratory supervised by Prof. Keren Bergman. 

Before starting my studies at Columbia, I worked as Physical Design Engineer at
Intel (2011-13), Apple (2013-16), and Cisco (2016-17). 

I received B.Sc. in Physics and B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Technion -
Israel Institute of Technology in 2014. During my studies I started to work at
Intel, and then moved to Apple.
