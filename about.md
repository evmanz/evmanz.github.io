My name is Evgeny Manzhosov. 

Currently, I am working on my Ph.D. under the supervision of Professor [Simha
Sethumadhavan](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~simha/) at Columbia University. 

At the beginning of my Ph.D., I worked on memory safety and pointer integrity
solutions, afterward drifting towards the intersection of security and
reliability of systems. My current work is focused on the intersection of
security and reliability for general-purpose and specialized computing (e.g.,
ML, ML with Homomorphic Encryption). Other than that, I am interested in
compilers, program analysis, and hardware/software co-design. Unfortunately,
there are way more interesting things to look at than I can realistically handle
in a reasonable amount of time, so I have to pick. :)

Before joining Prof. Sethumadhavan's Lab, I finished my M.Sc. at the Department
of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University with an Award of Excellence.
During my master's, I worked on several research projects in the Lightwave
Research Laboratory supervised by Prof. Keren Bergman.

I received a B.Sc. in Physics and a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from
Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, which  I attended from Fall 2008 to
Spring 2014. I began to work at Intel in 2011 part-time while studying, a common
practice at the Technion. In 2013, I moved to Apple. In fact, I was the first
student worker at Apple Israel. In November of the same year, I became full-time
while finishing my undergraduate studies. In 2016, I left Apple for Cisco, and
one year later, in 2017, I started my studies at Columbia.
