I am honored to be one of the three RSA Security Scholar Pitch Off event winners with my proposal "PAIRS: Control Flow Protection Using Phantom Addressed Instructions."

PAIRS is the first project I worked on in my CS Ph.D. journey at Columbia. I am grateful to have Mohamed Tarek and Miguel Arroyo as co-authors and colleagues -- without them, it wouldn't have happened.
