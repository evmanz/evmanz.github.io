My name is Evgeny Manzhosov. 

Currently, I am working on my Ph.D. under the supervision of prof. Simha Sethumadhavan at Columbia University. 

Before joining prof. Sethumadhavan's Lab, I finished my MSc degree at the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University with an Award of Excellence. 
I received B.Sc. in Physics and B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in 2014. 

Before starting my studies at Columbia, I worked as Physical Design Engineer at Intel (2011-13), Apple (2013-16), and Cisco (2016-17).
